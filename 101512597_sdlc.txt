DevOps is essential in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it bridges the gap between development and operations. 
It ensures faster delivery of features, higher code quality, and improved collaboration across teams. 
By integrating continuous integration and continuous deployment, DevOps reduces risks, shortens release cycles, and promotes automation. 
This approach leads to more reliable software and a smoother process from planning to deployment, making it a critical part of modern SDLC practices.

DevOps fosters better collaboration between developers, testers, and operations teams.

Automation is central to DevOps, ensuring consistency, speed, and reliability.
