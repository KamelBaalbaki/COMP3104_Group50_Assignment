What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud-based platform built on the Git version control system that serves as a web-based hosting service for software repositories,
enabling developers to store, manage, and share their code, collaborate on projects, track changes, and contribute to open-source communities.
It provides a user-friendly interface for developers to work together, manage tasks, and integrate continuous processes like automated builds and
deployments into their workflows. 

Key Functions and Features:

Version Control: It uses Git to track changes to files over time, allowing developers to revert to previous versions, view the history of modifications,
and understand who changed what and when.

Collaboration: GitHub facilitates teamwork by providing tools for code review, issue tracking, and project management, enabling multiple people to 
contribute to a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. 

Code Hosting: It acts as a centralized, cloud-based space to store and host all project files, including code and assets, making them accessible from 
anywhere. 

Repositories: A repository is a project's central storage location, holding all its files and the complete revision history of every change made to 
the code. 

Pull Requests: This is a feature where a developer proposes changes they've made to a repository for others to review and merge into the main codebase. 

Open Source: GitHub is a popular hub for open-source projects, allowing anyone to view, use, and contribute to public repositories for free. 


How it Works

Local Git: You first use Git on your local computer to manage changes in your project. 
Push to GitHub: You then "push" your local repository to GitHub, creating an online, cloud-based version of your project. 
Collaboration: Other team members can "clone" your repository, work on their own branches, and then "pull" their changes back 
to the shared repository for review and merging.
