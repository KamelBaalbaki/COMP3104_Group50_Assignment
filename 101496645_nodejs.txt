What is Node JS:

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code 
outside of a web browser. Traditionally, JavaScript was limited to client-side web development within browsers. 

Node.js, built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, extends JavaScript's capabilities to server-side and general-purpose 
programming.
