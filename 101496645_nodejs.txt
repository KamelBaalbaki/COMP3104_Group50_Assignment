What is Node JS:

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code 
outside of a web browser. Traditionally, JavaScript was limited to client-side web development within browsers. 

Node.js, built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, extends JavaScript's capabilities to server-side and general-purpose 
programming.

Key aspects of Node.js:

Runtime Environment: It provides the necessary components to run JavaScript programs independently, similar to how other 
programming languages like Python or Ruby can be executed.

Server-Side Development: Node.js enables the creation of backend web servers and APIs using JavaScript, allowing for a unified 
language for both frontend and backend development.

Asynchronous and Event-Driven: Node.js is designed for building scalable network applications by handling many simultaneous 
connections efficiently through its non-blocking, event-driven architecture.

npm (Node Package Manager): It comes with npm, a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and tools that simplify project management and dependency handling.
Cross-Platform: Node.js runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.
