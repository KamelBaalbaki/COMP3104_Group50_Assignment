   git clone https://github.com/KamelBaalbaki/COMP3104_Group50_Assignment.git

2. Switch to your branch (replace with your own StudentID):
   git checkout -b STUDENTID-Name

3. Push your branch to GitHub:
   git push -u origin STUDENTID-Name 

## CI/CD Pipeline 

The project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration.
- Workflow file location: .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Runs on every push and pull request.
- Jobs include:
  - Checking out repository code.
  - Confirming workflow execution.
  - Listing repository files as a build step. 

## Branching Strategy 
- Each member created their own branch using the format:
  STUDENTID-Name
  Example: 101512597-JoelChandraPaul

- Changes were committed to personal branches.
- Branches were merged into the main branch via pull requests.
- Merge conflicts (if any) were resolved collaboratively.
